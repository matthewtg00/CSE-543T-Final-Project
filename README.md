# CSE-543T-Final-Project
 We used dataset from nutrients_csvfile_small.csv which contains information regarding 28 different food item. 
 WE define the food taste score and preference score for each item.
 Based on this we developed the objective function as the sum of difference between actual percentage and optimal percentage regarding carbohydrate, fat and protein and developed several constraints. 
 We then used 6 different solvers from Scipy package to solve our optimization problems.
